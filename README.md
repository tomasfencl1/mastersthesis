# mastersthesis
The main purpose of this repository is to provide replication files for my master's thesis in a structured form of a complete tree of folders and files. Hopefully, this will enhance the transparency of my results and simplify possible replication of my work. The "data" folder is included only to complement the project structure and intentionally does not contain any actual datasets. The HFCS and EU-LFS data used in the analysis are not publicly available and were provided under data access agreements that prohibit redistribution. Also the estimated monetary policy shocks are not to be shared. Other macroeconomic variables used in the project can be traced using the descriptions and data codes provided in the thesis text.

## abstract
This thesis studies the transmission of monetary policy in the Czech economy through the lens of household heterogeneity. Standard macroeconomic models often rely on representative agents, while real-world households differ in income, wealth, and financial constraints - features that can significantly shape their responses to policy changes. We apply a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian-type analytical decomposition to quantify how interest rate changes affect household consumption through five distinct channels, combining micro-level data from Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) and EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) with vector autoregression-based aggregate responses to a monetary policy shock. Czech households are classified into groups based on income and wealth, revealing a non-negligible (though smaller than commonly assumed) share of hand-to-mouth households. Results show substantial heterogeneity in the strength and composition of transmission channels: intertemporal substitution dominates for non-hand-to-mouth households, while income and capital gains channels matter more for the liquidity-constrained. Including heterogeneity amplifies the simulated consumption response by a factor of three relative to a representative-agent benchmark.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such application for the Czech Republic, and our findings highlight the importance of household-level frictions in macroeconomic modelling and policy design.
